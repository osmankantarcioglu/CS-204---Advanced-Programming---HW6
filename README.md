# CS 204 â€“ Advanced Programming-  HW6
 In this homework, I will write a multithreaded C++ program that simulates the game "Guess the Number." I will start by taking inputs for the number of players, the number of rounds, and the randomization range of the number to be guessed. Then, I will simulate each round of the game using several threads, one for each player and one for the host of the game. I will ensure that the program prints relevant information as demonstrated in the sample runs. After the host starts the game, I will make sure the player threads sleep until a specific time so that all players begin the game simultaneously.
